Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the web. It is the protocol used by web browsers and servers to exchange information over the internet. HTTP has gone through several iterations, with the most recent versions being HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. In this blog, we will explore the differences between these two versions of HTTP.

HTTP/1.1
HTTP/1.1 was released in 1999 and has been the primary version of HTTP used on the web for over two decades. It is a text-based protocol, which means that the messages sent between the client and server are human-readable. HTTP/1.1 uses a request-response model where the client sends a request to the server, and the server responds with the requested resource.

One of the main limitations of HTTP/1.1 is that it can only handle one request at a time. This means that if a web page has multiple resources, such as images and scripts, each resource has to be requested separately, and the server can only respond to one request at a time. This results in latency, as the client has to wait for each resource to be downloaded before it can start rendering the page.

Another limitation of HTTP/1.1 is that it is not optimized for mobile networks. Mobile networks have high latency and low bandwidth, which can make browsing slow and frustrating. HTTP/1.1 exacerbates this problem by requiring multiple round trips between the client and server for each request.

HTTP/2
HTTP/2 was released in 2015 and is the successor to HTTP/1.1. It is a binary protocol, which means that the messages sent between the client and server are in a compact, binary format that is not human-readable. HTTP/2 uses the same request-response model as HTTP/1.1, but with several improvements.

One of the main improvements in HTTP/2 is the ability to handle multiple requests simultaneously. This is achieved through a feature called multiplexing, which allows multiple requests to be sent over a single connection. This reduces latency and improves performance by allowing the client to download multiple resources in parallel.

Another improvement in HTTP/2 is server push, which allows the server to push resources to the client before they are requested. This can improve page load times by reducing the number of round trips between the client and server.

HTTP/2 also includes several optimizations for mobile networks, such as header compression and prioritization. Header compression reduces the amount of data sent between the client and server, while prioritization allows the client to specify which resources are more important and should be downloaded first.

Conclusion
In conclusion, HTTP/2 is a significant improvement over HTTP/1.1. It is faster, more efficient, and better optimized for mobile networks. With the growing demand for high-performance web applications, HTTP/2 is becoming the de facto standard for web communication. While HTTP/1.1 is still widely used, it is likely to be phased out in favor of HTTP/2 in the coming years.
